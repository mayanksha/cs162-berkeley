ll withdrawal forms submitted on or after the first day of instruction are “withdrawals,” and a student would be liable for some or all of the fees assessed by the University. The effective date of your withdrawal (i.e., the date you submit the withdrawal form) will determine how much you would owe the University and whether you would receive a refund of any fees paid.
